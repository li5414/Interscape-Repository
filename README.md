# Interscape: 
An open-world topdown 2D game made in Unity! Uses procedural generation to generate very large maps and worlds that are fun to explore. Still under development; there are many more features that plan to be added. In its current state, the player can walk around, chop trees and pick up items.

Here are some different biomes so far. Biome blending has been implemented in a shader to enable smooth gradient transitions between biomes.

Here are some screenshots of the UI so far. The inventory has a weight system that gives the player a speed debuff if they carry too much.

Here is what the map of a random seed looks like. The warmer biomes generate at the equator and the cooler biomes toward the poles. There are also no large oceans so player travel doesn't get too boring. Layered perlin noise is used for the world generation by creating a heat, moisture and height map.

So far, this has been an entirely solo project. All animation/art is drawn from scratch by Jess in Procreate for iPad.
